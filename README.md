# Pokedex Problem

Came across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqII0AOW1NM&) video from [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) simulating a technical interview.

From the provided interview [guide](https://t3-tools.notion.site/Technical-Interview-Dan-Abramov-9aa6d8e9292e4bd1ae67b44aeeaabf88), there is [this](https://t3-tools.notion.site/Pokedex-Problem-90f9dcfff10d4418a6fad44581b1ecff) problem targeted for junior to midlevel frontend developers.

Having gained familiarity with TypeScript / React, and building Rest APIs in Express, using this to demonstrate ability to fetch data client side, render, and manage state in a react context.

Using Daisy UI for quick prototyping, although, not best for accessibility (from what I remember)

## plan

[] 1st iteration - useEffect, useState, prop drilling ( probably solution I'd use in constraints of an actual interview)

[] 2nd iteration - custom hook

[] 3rd iteration - Redux Toolkit / RTK Query or React Query

- Theme Switch
- Pagination
- Animations
- Error Handling / Loader Skeletons
- try implementing layout animations for deleting rows / etc as seen from Sam Selikoff's YT channel

## note

Using this as a client side only project

App ideas make more sense in a full-stack context so just using this for practice for pure frontend reading from api, displaying data, state management and etc!
